# Interactive Sorting Visualization Tool

This project is an interactive tool built using **React**, **JSX**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that helps users visually understand and interact with various sorting algorithms in real-time. It improves comprehension by demonstrating how different sorting methods work and their relative performance.

## Features

- **Interactive Sorting Visualization Tool**:  
  Developed using **React**, **JSX**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this tool allows users to visually understand and interact with various sorting algorithms in real-time, improving comprehension of how sorting works.

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**:  
  Implemented a variety of popular sorting algorithms, including **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**, and **Selection Sort**. Users can select any algorithm and watch the sorting process unfold, helping them understand both the logic and performance of each algorithm.

- **Real-Time Visualization**:  
  Designed dynamic, animated visualizations where sorting bars represent array elements. As the algorithm runs, users can see the bars move and change positions, providing a clear and engaging representation of the sorting process.

- **Customizable User Controls**:  
  Added interactive features such as an **array size selector** to adjust the number of elements, and a **sorting speed adjustment** to control the animation pace. These features allow users to experiment with different array configurations and observe how sorting performance is affected.

- **Physics-Based Animations**:  
  Integrated real-time physics for animating the sorting bars, where each bar acts like a segment on a string hanging from the ceiling. When a user’s mouse interacts with a bar, it applies a force that causes the bar to move away, similar to how a string would react to a force applied to it. This makes the visualization more responsive and engaging.
